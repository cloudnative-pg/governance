# Contributing to CloudNativePG

Welcome! We are glad that you want to contribute to the CloudNativePG project! 💖

The guidelines below are a starting point for all repositories under the
CloudNativePG organization. We don't want to limit your creativity, passion,
and initiative. If you think there are other things you can contribute, please
feel free to bring it up in a GitHub Issue, or open a Pull Request!

## Code of Conduct

Before contributing, please review our core policies:

- **[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**: Our standards for a welcoming
  community.
- **[AI Policy](AI_POLICY.md)**: Guidelines regarding the use of Generative AI
  in contributions.

## The "Human-First" Contribution Disclaimer

CloudNativePG is a community-driven project. While many maintainers are
sponsored by their respective employers, they operate here on a voluntary
basis.

> [^IMPORTANT]
> **We are all human beings with finite time and a limited amount of cognitive
> load we can sustain at any given moment.** Given the rapid growth and technical
> complexity of the project, maintainers must carefully balance planned roadmap
> items and critical maintenance (such as the current transition of Barman Cloud
> to plugins and moving from base-image extensions to self-contained ones).

To respect everyone's time, please follow these steps before submitting a Pull
Request:

1.  **Open an Issue**: Always start by opening a GitHub Issue to discuss your
    idea.
2.  **Wait for Alignment**: Ensure maintainers have agreed on the approach and
    the priority before you start coding.
3.  **Experimental Path**: If your patch cannot wait or is highly experimental,
    remember that the **CNPG-I interface** provides the freedom to build and test
    features as plugins. Once a feature is proven and well-received by the
    community, we can discuss moving it into the core.

## External Contributors vs Maintainers

**External Contributors:** If you're contributing to the CloudNativePG operator
from outside the core team, please note that some instructions in our detailed
development docs apply only to maintainers.
See the [development contribution guide](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/blob/main/contribute/README.md)
for complete details, but note:

- **Issue Assignment**: Comment "I'd like to work on this" on an issue rather than self-assigning.
- **Testing**: Run local tests before submitting. Repository-specific testing
  instructions can be found in the respective `CONTRIBUTING.md` or
  `contribute/` folders of each repo.
- **Project Boards**: Maintainers handle the movement of tickets through
  project phases.

## Community Meetings

We extend a warm welcome to everyone to join our meetings. For details, please
